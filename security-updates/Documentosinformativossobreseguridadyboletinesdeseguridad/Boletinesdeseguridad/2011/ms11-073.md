Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2587634)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Publicado: martes, 13 de septiembre de 2011

**Versión:** 1.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Office file or if a user opens a legitimate Office file that is located in the same network directory as a specially crafted library file. An attacker who successfully exploited either of the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the logged on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Microsoft Office 2003, Microsoft Office 2007, and Microsoft Office 2010. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting the way Microsoft Office loads external libraries and initializes objects. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, Vulnerability Information.

**Recommendation.** Customers can configure automatic updating to check online for updates from Microsoft Update by using the [Microsoft Update](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. Customers who have automatic updating enabled and configured to check online for updates from Microsoft Update typically will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates from Microsoft Update and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating in supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871). For information about automatic updating in supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, see [Understanding Windows automatic updating](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/understanding-windows-automatic-updating).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** None

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update
----------------------------------------------------------------

**Where are the file information details?**  
Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**  
This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.

**How are** **Microsoft Office standalone programs affected by the vulnerabilities?**  
A Microsoft Office standalone program is affected with the same severity rating as the corresponding component in a Microsoft Office Suite. For example, a standalone installation of Microsoft Word is affected with the same severity rating as an installation of Microsoft Word that was delivered with a Microsoft Office Suite.

**I have a non-vulnerable version of software installed, why am I being offered this update?**  
Some non-affected software, including Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats, Microsoft Word Viewer, Microsoft Excel Viewer, and Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer, contain the vulnerable shared component of Microsoft Office, but because they do not access the vulnerable code, they are not affected by this vulnerability. However, since the vulnerable code is present, this update will be offered.

**Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office constitute an issue in the Microsoft update mechanism?**  
No, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a lower version of the files on the system than in the update package and thus, offers the update.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**  
The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) Web site.

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see [Select a Product for Lifecycle Information](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169555). For more information about service packs for these software releases, see [Lifecycle Supported Service Packs](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=89213).

Customers who require custom support for older software must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit the [Microsoft Worldwide Information](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329) Web site, select the country in the Contact Information list, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers.

Office Component Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1980
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Office handles the loading of DLL files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-1980](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2011-1980).

#### Mitigating Factors for Office Component Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1980

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

-   For an attack to be successful, a user must visit an untrusted remote file system location or WebDAV share and open an Office-related file (such as a .doc file).
-   The file sharing protocol, Server Message Block (SMB), is often disabled on the perimeter firewall. This limits the potential attack vectors for this vulnerability.
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds for Office Component Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1980

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

-   **Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations**

    Microsoft Office File Block policy can be used to block specific file format types from opening in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint.

    **For Microsoft Office** **2003 and Microsoft Office** **2007**

    The following registry scripts can be saved in registry entry (.reg) files and used to set the File Block policy. For more information on how to use registry scripts, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 310516](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310516).
  
    **Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2007, all of the latest security updates for Office 2007 must be applied.

**Impact of workaround.** For Microsoft Office 2007, users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special exempt directory or have not moved files to a trusted location will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions. For more information about the impact of file block setting in Microsoft Office software, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922850](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/922850).

-   **Disable loading of libraries from WebDAV and remote network shares**
  
    **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107) to deploy a workaround tool that allows customers to disable the loading of libraries from remote network or WebDAV shares. This tool can be configured to disallow insecure loading on a per-application or a global system basis.

    Customers who are informed by their vendor of an application being vulnerable can use this tool to help protect against attempts to exploit this issue.
  
    **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to deploy the registry key to block loading of libraries for SMB and WebDAV shares. Note that this Fix it solution does require you to install the workaround tool also described in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107) first. This Fix it solution only deploys the registry key and requires the workaround tool in order to be effective. We recommend that administrators review the KB article closely prior to deploying this Fix it solution.

-   **Disable the WebClient service**

    Disabling the WebClient service helps protect affected systems from attempts to exploit this vulnerability by blocking the most likely remote attack vector through the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) client service. After applying this workaround it is still possible for remote attackers who successfully exploit this vulnerability to cause the system to run programs located on the targeted user's computer or the Local Area Network (LAN), but users will be prompted for confirmation before opening arbitrary programs from the Internet.

    To disable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:

    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.
    2.  Right-click **WebClient** service and select **Properties**.
    3.  Change the Startup type to **Disabled**. If the service is running, click **Stop**.
    4.  Click **OK** and exit the management application.

    **Impact of workaround.** When the WebClient service is disabled, Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) requests are not transmitted. In addition, any services that explicitly depend on the Web Client service will not start, and an error message will be logged in the System log. For example, WebDAV shares will be inaccessible from the client computer.

    **How to undo the workaround.**

    To re-enable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:

    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.
    2.  Right-click **WebClient** service and select **Properties**.
    3.  Change the Startup type to **Automatic**. If the service is not running, click **Start**.
    4.  Click **OK** and exit the management application.

-   **Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall**

    These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see the TechNet article, [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

    **Impact of workaround.** Several Windows services use the affected ports. Blocking connectivity to the ports may cause various applications or services to not function. Some of the applications or services that could be impacted are listed below:

    -   Applications that use SMB (CIFS)
    -   Applications that use mailslots or named pipes (RPC over SMB)
    -   Server (File and Print Sharing)
    -   Group Policy
    -   Net Logon
    -   Distributed File System (DFS)
    -   Terminal Server Licensing

#### FAQ for Office Component Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1980

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**  
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**  
The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft Office incorrectly restricts the path used for loading external libraries.

**How is Microsoft Office affected by this vulnerability?**  
Although the known attack vectors can only leverage specific Microsoft Office binary formats, the vulnerable code exists in a shared component of Microsoft Office.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**  
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If a user is logged-on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**  
This vulnerability only affects .doc, .xls, and.ppt Office binary formats when the Office File Validation Add-in is not installed.

An attacker could convince a user to open a legitimate Office-related file (such as a .doc file) that is located in the same network directory as a specially crafted dynamic link library (DLL) file. Then, while opening the legitimate file, Microsoft Office could attempt to load the DLL file and execute any code it contained.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a legitimate Office-related file attachment (such as a .doc file) to a user, and convincing the user to place the attachment into a directory containing a specially crafted DLL file and to open the legitimate file. Then, while opening the legitimate file, Microsoft Office could attempt to load the DLL file and execute any code it contained.

In a network attack scenario, an attacker could place a legitimate Office-related file and a specially crafted DLL in a network share, a UNC, or WebDAV location and then convince the user to open the file.

**What is the Microsoft Office File Validation Add-in?**  
Office File Validation is a security add-in for Office 2003 and 2007. Office File Validation is used to validate that Binary File Format files conform to the Microsoft Office File Format. The user will be notified of possible security risks if files fail to conform to the format. More information about this add-in can be found in [Knowledge Base Article 2501584](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2501584).

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**  
Systems where Microsoft Office is used, including workstations and terminal servers, are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**  
The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting the manner in which Microsoft Office loads external libraries.

**Is this vulnerability related to Microsoft Security Advisory 2269637?**  
Yes, this vulnerability is related to the class of vulnerabilities, described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2269637](http://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2269637), that affects how applications load external libraries. This security update addresses a particular instance of this type of vulnerability.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**  
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**  
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

Office Uninitialized Object Pointer Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1982
-----------------------------------------------------------------

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Office handles specially crafted Word files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-1982](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2011-1982).

#### Mitigating Factors for Office Uninitialized Object Pointer Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1982

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

-   The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker’s Web site.

#### Workarounds for Office Uninitialized Object Pointer Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1982

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

-   **Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations**

    Microsoft Office File Block policy can be used to block specific file format types from opening in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint.

    **For Microsoft Office 2007**

    The following registry scripts can be saved in registry entry (.reg) files and used to set the File Block policy. For more information on how to use registry scripts, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 310516](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310516).
  
    **Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2007, all of the latest security updates for Office 2007 must be applied.

            - Word 6.0 Binary Documents and Templates
            - Word 2 and earlier Binary Documents and Templates
        6.  Under Open behavior for selected file types, select "Do not open selected file types" or select "Open selected file types in Protected View". Either choice will block the attack vector to the vulnerable code.
        7.  Click **OK** to apply the File Block Settings.

    Alternatively, file block can be applied using Group Policy. For more information, see the TechNet article, [Plan file block settings for Office 2010](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc179230.aspx).

    **Impact of workaround.** For Microsoft Office 2007, users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special exempt directory or have not moved files to a trusted location will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions. For Microsoft Office 2010, Office 2003 files or earlier versions will either be blocked from opening or will be opened in protected mode depending on the open behavior that was selected. For more information about the impact of file block setting in Microsoft Office software, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922850](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/922850).

|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **/q**      | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted.                                        |  
| **/q:u**    | Specifies user-quiet mode, which presents some dialog boxes to the user.                                            |  
| **/q:a**    | Specifies administrator-quiet mode, which does not present any dialog boxes to the user.                            |  
| **/t:path** | Specifies the target folder for extracting files.                                                                   |  
| **/c**      | Extracts the files without installing them. If **/t:path** is not specified, you are prompted for a target folder.  |  
| **/c:path** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |  
| **/r:n**    | Never restarts the system after installation.                                                                       |  
| **/r:I**    | Prompts the user to restart the system if a restart is required, except when used with **/q:a**.                    |  
| **/r:a**    | Always restarts the system after installation.                                                                      |  
| **/r:s**    | Restarts the system after installation without prompting the user.                                                  |  
| **/n:v**    | No version checking - Install the program over any earlier version.                                                 |
  
**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).
  
**Removing the Update**

    3.  On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.   
        **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.  
    4.  You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.   
        **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.  
    5.  Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.
